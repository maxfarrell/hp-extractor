Note: The specific species of helminth parasites are not mentioned in the abstract. However, it is stated that 19 exotic helminth species were found in translocated raccoons while another 5 species were present only in resident raccoons and an additional 19 species were found in both groups. Three of these exotic species and 10 of the enzootic species are known to have some degree of pathogenicity. |
