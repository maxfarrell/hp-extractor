Here is the graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

```
CREATE (abs:Abstract {absID: "Hepatozoon ursi n. sp. (Apicomplexa: Hepatozoidae) in Japanese black bear (Ursus thibetanus japonicus). Morphological and genetic features of a new Hepatozoon species"})
CREATE (host:Host {name: "Japanese black bear", synonym: "Ursus thibetanus japonicus", abs: abs})
CREATE (pathogen:Pathogen {name: "Hepatozoon ursi", synonym: "Hepatozoon ursi n. sp.", abs: abs})
CREATE (class:Class {name: "Apicomplexa", abs: abs})
CREATE (family:Family {name: "Hepatozoidae", abs: abs})
CREATE (order:Order {name: "Apicomplexa", abs: abs})
CREATE (genus:Genus {name: "Hepatozoon", abs: abs})

CREATE (host)-[:HOST_OF {abs: abs}]->(pathogen)
CREATE (pathogen)-[:BELONGS_TO {abs: abs}]->(genus)
CREATE (genus)-[:BELONGS_TO {abs: abs}]->(family)
CREATE (family)-[:BELONGS_TO {abs: abs}]->(class)
CREATE (class)-[:ORDER_OF {abs: abs}]->(order)

CREATE (order)-[:CLASS_OF {abs: abs}]->(class)
CREATE (family)-[:SUBCLASS_OF {abs: abs}]->(class)
CREATE (genus)-[:SUBCLASS_OF {abs: abs}]->(family)
CREATE (pathogen)-[:SUBCLASS_OF {abs: abs}]->(genus)
CREATE (host)-[:SUBCLASS_OF {abs: abs}]->(pathogen)
```

Note: The `abs` property is used to link each node and relationship to the abstract. The `absID` property is not used in this example, but you can add it to each node and relationship if needed.

This graph database includes the following entities:

* Abstract (abs)
* Host (host)
* Pathogen (pathogen)
* Class (class)
* Family (family)
* Order (order)
* Genus (genus)

The relationships between these entities are:

* A host can have a pathogen (HOST_OF)
* A pathogen belongs to a genus (BELONGS_TO)
* A genus belongs to a family (BELONGS_TO)
* A family belongs to a class (BELONGS_TO)
* A class is part of an order (ORDER_OF)
* An order is a subclass of a class (CLASS_OF)
* A family is a subclass of a class (SUBCLASS_OF)
* A genus is a subclass of a family (SUBCLASS_OF)
* A pathogen is a subclass of a genus (SUBCLASS_OF)
* A host is a subclass of a pathogen (SUBCLASS_OF)

Each node and relationship has an `abs` property that links it to the abstract.
