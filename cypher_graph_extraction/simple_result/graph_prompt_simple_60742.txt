Note: The `RELATIONSHIP_TO` and `HAS_PROPERTY` relationships are used to establish the relationships between the nodes. The `IS_ABSTRACT`, `IS_RELATED_TO`, `HAS_HOST`, and `HAS_TITLE` relationships are used to establish the relationships between the nodes and the abstract. The `absID` property is used to identify each node and relationship.
