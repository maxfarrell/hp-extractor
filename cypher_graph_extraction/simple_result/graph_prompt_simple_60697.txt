Here is the graph database in Neo4j Cypher format:

Note:

* I assumed that the "Ecology of the gastrointestinal parasites of Colobus vellerosus at Boabeng-Fiema" is the abstract of the study, so I created a node for it with the label "Abstract".
* I created nodes for the host, pathogen, location, and study, and assigned them labels and properties accordingly.
* I created relationships between the nodes to represent the relationships between the host, pathogen, location, and study. The relationships are:
	+ HOST_OF: represents the relationship between the host and the study
	+ PATHOGEN_OF: represents the relationship between the pathogen and the study
	+ LOCATED_IN: represents the relationship between the study and the location
	+ INFECTED_BY: represents the relationship between the host and the pathogen
