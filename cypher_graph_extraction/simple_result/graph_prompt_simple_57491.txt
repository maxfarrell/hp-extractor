Note:

* `abs` represents the abstract of the study.
* `host` represents the Hawaiian monk seal, which is the host of the infectious disease.
* `pathogen` represents the infectious disease.
* `conservation_effort` represents the conservation efforts between 1997 and 2001.
* `time_range` represents the time period during which the conservation efforts took place.
* `disease_monitoring` represents the activity of monitoring the infectious disease.
* `study` represents the study on infectious disease monitoring of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal.

The relationships between these nodes are:

* `HAS_HOST`: The abstract is related to the host (Hawaiian monk seal).
* `HAS_PATHOGEN`: The abstract is related to the pathogen (infectious disease).
* `IS_PART_OF`: The abstract is part of the conservation effort.
* `OCCURS_DURING`: The conservation effort occurs during the time period.
* `HAS_ACTIVITY`: The abstract is related to the activity of disease monitoring.
* `INVOLVES`: The conservation effort involves the activity of disease monitoring.
* `IS_STUDY`: The abstract is a study on infectious disease monitoring of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal.
* `OCCURS_DURING`: The study occurs during the time period.
* `INVOLVES`: The study involves the conservation effort.
* `MONITORS`: The study monitors the activity of disease monitoring.
