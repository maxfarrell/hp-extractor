Here is the detailed graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

```

```

Note: I assumed that the abstract is the top-level entity, and the study is a related entity. I also assumed that the host-pathogen relationship is a many-to-many relationship, as a single host can have multiple pathogens and a single pathogen can infect multiple hosts. Similarly, a single possum can have multiple tuberculosis cases and a single tuberculosis case can be detected in multiple possums.
