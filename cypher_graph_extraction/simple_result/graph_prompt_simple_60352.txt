Here is the graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

```
CREATE (abs:Abstract {absID: "1"})
CREATE (study:Study {absID: "1"})
CREATE (location:Location {name: "Western Alps", absID: "1"})
CREATE (country:Country {name: "Italy", absID: "1"})
CREATE (host:Host {name: "Foxes", absID: "1", synonym: ["Foxes"]})
CREATE (host2:Host {name: "Badgers", absID: "1", synonym: ["Badgers"]})
CREATE (pathogen:Pathogen {name: "Physaloptera sibirica", absID: "1", synonym: ["Physaloptera sibirica"]})

CREATE (study)-[:LOCATED_IN {absID: "1"}]->(location)
CREATE (study)-[:FOUND_IN {absID: "1"}]->(country)
CREATE (study)-[:INFECTED_HOST {absID: "1"}]->(host)
CREATE (study)-[:INFECTED_HOST {absID: "1"}]->(host2)
CREATE (study)-[:INFECTED_BY {absID: "1"}]->(pathogen)
CREATE (host)-[:IS_HOST_OF {absID: "1"}]->(pathogen)
CREATE (host2)-[:IS_HOST_OF {absID: "1"}]->(pathogen)
```

This graph database includes the following entities:

* `Abstract`: represents the abstract of the study
* `Study`: represents the study itself
* `Location`: represents the location where the study was conducted
* `Country`: represents the country where the study was conducted
* `Host`: represents the hosts (foxes and badgers) that were infected with the pathogen
* `Pathogen`: represents the pathogen (Physaloptera sibirica) that was found in the hosts

The relationships between these entities are as follows:

* `study` is located in `location`
* `study` was conducted in `country`
* `study` infected `host` with `pathogen`
* `study` infected `host2` with `pathogen`
* `host` is a host of `pathogen`
* `host2` is a host of `pathogen`

Note that the `absID` property is used to link each node and relationship to the original abstract.
