Here is the graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

```

```

Note: The `absID` property is added to each node and relationship to link them to the original abstract. The `LOCATED_IN` relationship represents the location where the abstract was published, the `CONTAINS` relationship represents the ecosystem where the primates were found, the `INHABITED_BY` relationship represents the host species, and the `INFECTED_WITH` relationship represents the pathogens.
