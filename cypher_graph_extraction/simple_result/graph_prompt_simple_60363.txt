Note:

* `Abstract` is a node representing the abstract of the paper.
* `Host` and `Pathogen` are nodes representing the host and pathogen involved in the study.
* `Host_Has_Pathogen` is a node representing the relationship between the host and pathogen.
* `Symptom` is a node representing the symptom exhibited by the host.
* `Age` is a node representing the age of the host.
* The relationships between nodes are represented using labels such as `HAS_PATHOGEN`, `IS_HOST`, `EXHIBITS`, and `HAS_AGE`.
