This graph database includes the following entities:

* `Abstract`: represents the abstract of the study
* `HostType`: represents the type of host (e.g. species)
* `Host`: represents a specific host individual
* `PathogenType`: represents the type of pathogen (e.g. genus)
* `Pathogen`: represents a specific pathogen
* `Specimen`: represents a specific specimen (e.g. tissue sample)
* `Sample`: represents a sample of a host individual
* `Detection`: represents the detection of a pathogen in a sample
* `Study`: represents a study
* `Location`: represents a location
* `StudyLocation`: represents the location of a study
* `HostPathogenRelationship`: represents the relationship between a host and a pathogen
* `SampleDetection`: represents the detection of a pathogen in a sample
* `StudySample`: represents the relationship between a study and a sample

The relationships between these entities include:

* `abs` property: connects each entity to the abstract of the study
* `host_type` property: connects a host to its host type
* `host` property: connects a sample to its host individual
* `pathogen_type` property: connects a pathogen to its pathogen type
* `pathogen` property: connects a detection to its pathogen
* `specimen` property: connects a sample to its specimen
* `study` property: connects a sample to its study
* `location` property: connects a study to its location
* `host_pathogen_relationship` property: connects a host to a pathogen
* `sample_detection` property: connects a sample to its detection
* `study_sample` property: connects a study to its sample
