Here is the graph database in Neo4j Cypher format:

```
CREATE (abs:Abstract {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"})

CREATE (host1:Host {name: "Hooded seal", synonym: "Cystophora cristata"})
CREATE (host2:Host {name: "Harp seal", synonym: "Phoca groenlandica"})

CREATE (pathogen:Pathogen {name: "Morbillivirus"})

CREATE (seal1:Seal {name: "Juvenile female hooded seal", host: host1})
CREATE (seal2:Seal {name: "Juvenile male harp seal", host: host2})

CREATE (seal1)-[:INFECTED_BY {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->(pathogen)
CREATE (seal2)-[:INFECTED_BY {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->(pathogen)

CREATE (seal1)-[:STRANDED {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->(location:Location {name: "New Jersey coast"})
CREATE (seal2)-[:STRANDED {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->(location)

CREATE (seal1)-[:TAKEN_TO {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->(rehabilitation_center:Rehabilitation_Center)
CREATE (seal2)-[:TAKEN_TO {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->(rehabilitation_center)

CREATE (seal1)-[:LETHARGIC {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->()
CREATE (seal1)-[:EMACIATED {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->()
CREATE (seal2)-[:LETHARGIC {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->()
CREATE (seal2)-[:EMACIATED {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->()

CREATE (rehabilitation_center)-[:HAS_SEAL {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->(seal1)
CREATE (rehabilitation_center)-[:HAS_SEAL {absID: "Morbilliviral dermatitis in seals"}]->(seal2)
```

Note that I added a `Location` node to represent the New Jersey coast, and a `Rehabilitation_Center` node to represent the marine mammal rehabilitation center. I also added relationships to represent the lethargy and emaciation of the seals.
