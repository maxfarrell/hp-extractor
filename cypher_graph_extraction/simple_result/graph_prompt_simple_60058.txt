This graph database includes the following entities:

* Abstract: represents the abstract of the study
* Study: represents the study itself, including its name, start and end dates, and location
* Host: represents the hosts (grizzly bears and black bears) studied in the paper, including their names, synonyms, scientific names, and absID
* Pathogen: represents the canine viral pathogen studied in the paper, including its name, synonym, and absID

The relationships between these entities are:

* HOST_OF: represents the relationship between a host and a study
* STUDYED: represents the relationship between a study and a pathogen
* IS_PATHOGEN_OF: represents the relationship between a pathogen and a host
* PUBLISHED_IN: represents the relationship between a study and an abstract
