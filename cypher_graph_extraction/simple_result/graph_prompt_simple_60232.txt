Note: The `absID` property is used to link the nodes and relationships to the original abstract. The `name` and `synonym` properties are used to provide additional information about the entities. The relationships between the nodes are defined using the following labels:

* `HAS_ABSTRACT`: The study has an abstract.
* `STUDY_HOST`: The study is conducted on a host.
* `STUDY_PATHOGEN`: The study is conducted on a pathogen.
* `HAS_ORGAN`: The host has an organ.
* `HAS_SAMPLE`: The study has a sample.
* `STUDY_SUBJECT`: The study is conducted on a subject.
* `STUDY_LOCATION`: The study is conducted in a location.

Please note that this is a simplified representation of the entities and relationships, and you may need to add or modify nodes and relationships based on your specific use case.
