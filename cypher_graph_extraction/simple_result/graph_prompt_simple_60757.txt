Here is the graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

Note: I've used the following labels and properties:

* `Abstract`: represents the abstract of the study
* `Population`: represents a population of animals
* `Host`: represents the host organism (in this case, the black-tailed deer)
* `Syndrome`: represents a medical condition (in this case, hair loss syndrome)
* `Pathogen`: represents a disease-causing agent (in this case, unknown)
* `Mortality`: represents a type of mortality
* `Fawn`: represents a young deer
* `Study`: represents the study itself
* `AFFLICTED_BY`: represents the relationship between a host and a syndrome
* `CAUSED_BY`: represents the relationship between a syndrome and a pathogen
* `HOST_TO`: represents the relationship between a host and a population
* `MORTALITY`: represents the relationship between a fawn and mortality
* `STUDIED`: represents the relationship between a study and a fawn
* `LOCATED_IN`: represents the relationship between a study and a population
* `RELATED_TO`: represents the relationship between an abstract and a study

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
