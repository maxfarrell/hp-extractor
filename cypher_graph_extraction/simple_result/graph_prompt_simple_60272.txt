Here is the graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

Note that I used the following conventions:

* `abs` nodes represent abstracts, and have an `absID` property.
* `Study` nodes represent studies, and have a `name` property.
* `Location` nodes represent locations, and have a `name` property.
* `Pathogen` nodes represent pathogens, and have a `name` and `synonym` property.
* `Host` nodes represent hosts, and have a `name` and `synonym` property.
* `Timeframe` nodes represent timeframes, and have a `start` property.
* `Capture` nodes represent captures, and have a `frequency` property.
* `Sample` nodes represent samples, and have a `type` property.
* `Test` nodes represent tests, and have a `method` property.

I also used the following relationships:

* `LOCATED_IN` represents the location of a study.
* `OCCURRED_IN` represents the timeframe of a study.
* `INVESTIGATED` represents the entities investigated in a study.
* `INFECTS` represents the infection of a host by a pathogen.
* `CONTAINS` represents the containment of a location by another location.
* `CAPTURED` represents the capture of a host.
* `ANALYZED` represents the analysis of a sample.
* `TESTED` represents the testing of a sample.
* `DETECTED` represents the detection of a pathogen in a sample.
* `HAS_ENTITY` represents the relationship between an abstract and an entity.
