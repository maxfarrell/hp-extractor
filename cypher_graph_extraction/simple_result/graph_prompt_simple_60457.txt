Here's a brief explanation of each node and relationship:

* `Abstract`: represents the abstract of the study
* `Host`: represents the American bison (Bison bison)
* `Bison`: represents the American bison (Bison bison) as a node for further relationships
* `Pathogen`: represents the Pasteurella spp.
* `Study`: represents the study itself
* `Location`: represents the free-ranging environment where the study took place
* `Time`: represents the time period during which the study occurred
* `HOSTED_BY`: represents the relationship between the host (American bison) and the study
* `FOUND_IN`: represents the relationship between the host (American bison) and the location (free-ranging environment)
* `INFECTED_WITH`: represents the relationship between the host (American bison) and the pathogen (Pasteurella spp.)
* `STUDIED`: represents the relationship between the study and the host (American bison)
* `OCCURRED_DURING`: represents the relationship between the study and the time period during which it occurred
* `ISOLATED`: represents the relationship between the pathogen (Pasteurella spp.) and the study
