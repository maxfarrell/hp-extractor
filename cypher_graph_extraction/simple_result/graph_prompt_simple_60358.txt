Here is the graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

This graph database includes the following entities:

* `Abstract`: represents the abstract of the study
* `Host`: represents the yellow mongoose species
* `Pathogen`: represents the Babesia cynicti species
* `Study`: represents the study itself
* `Population`: represents the three populations of yellow mongooses
* `Location`: represents the Transvaal region

The relationships between these entities are as follows:

* `HAS_HOST`: connects the study to the host species
* `HAS_PATHOGEN`: connects the study to the pathogen species
* `HAS_POPULATION`: connects the study to the three populations of yellow mongooses
* `IS_LOCATED_IN`: connects the study to the Transvaal region

Each node and relationship includes the `absID` property, which is set to the same value as the abstract ID.
