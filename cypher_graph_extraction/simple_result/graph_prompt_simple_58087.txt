Here is the graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

```

Here's a brief explanation of each node and relationship:

* `Abstract`: The abstract of the study.
* `Host`: The chamois, the host species.
* `Pathogen`: The steroid hormone related male biased parasitism, the pathogen.
* `Hormone`: The steroid hormone, a type of hormone.
* `System`: The endocrine system, a biological system.
* `Sex`: The male sex, a biological characteristic.
* `Parasitism`: The male biased parasitism, a type of parasitism.
* `STUDIES`: The relationship between the abstract and the host/pathogen.
* `HOST_OF`: The relationship between the host and the pathogen.
* `RELATED_TO`: The relationship between the pathogen and the hormone.
* `BIASED_TOWARDS`: The relationship between the pathogen and the male sex.
* `PART_OF`: The relationship between the hormone and the endocrine system.
* `SEX_OF`: The relationship between the male sex and the host.
* `CAUSES`: The relationship between the pathogen and the parasitism.
* `AFFECTS`: The relationship between the parasitism and the host.

Note that some of these nodes and relationships may not be explicitly mentioned in the abstract, but they are inferred based on the context and the biological concepts involved.
