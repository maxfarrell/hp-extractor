Based on the abstract, I'll create a detailed graph database with entities and relationships. Here's the graph database in Neo4j Cypher format:

```
// Nodes
CREATE (abs:Abstract {absID: "Behavior"})
CREATE (Host {absID: "Host", name: "Host", synonym: "Organism"})
CREATE (Pathogen {absID: "Pathogen", name: "Pathogen", synonym: "Infectious Agent"})
CREATE (Disease {absID: "Disease", name: "Disease", synonym: "Infection"})
CREATE (Symptom {absID: "Symptom", name: "Symptom", synonym: "Manifestation"})
CREATE (Sign {absID: "Sign", name: "Sign", synonym: "Clinical Feature"})
CREATE (Behavior {absID: "Behavior", name: "Behavior", synonym: "Action"})

// Relationships
CREATE (abs)-[:REL_ABSTRACTS]->(Host)
CREATE (abs)-[:REL_ABSTRACTS]->(Pathogen)
CREATE (abs)-[:REL_ABSTRACTS]->(Disease)
CREATE (abs)-[:REL_ABSTRACTS]->(Symptom)
CREATE (abs)-[:REL_ABSTRACTS]->(Sign)
CREATE (abs)-[:REL_ABSTRACTS]->(Behavior)

CREATE (Host)-[:REL_HOST_OF]->(Disease)
CREATE (Pathogen)-[:REL_PATHOGEN_OF]->(Disease)
CREATE (Disease)-[:REL_CAUSES]->(Symptom)
CREATE (Disease)-[:REL_CAUSES]->(Sign)
CREATE (Symptom)-[:REL_EXPERIENCED_BY]->(Host)
CREATE (Sign)-[:REL_EXPERIENCED_BY]->(Host)
CREATE (Behavior)-[:REL_PERFORMED_BY]->(Host)

CREATE (Host)-[:REL_INTERACTS_WITH]->(Pathogen)
CREATE (Pathogen)-[:REL_INTERACTS_WITH]->(Disease)
CREATE (Disease)-[:REL_INTERACTS_WITH]->(Symptom)
CREATE (Disease)-[:REL_INTERACTS_WITH]->(Sign)
CREATE (Symptom)-[:REL_INTERACTS_WITH]->(Behavior)
CREATE (Sign)-[:REL_INTERACTS_WITH]->(Behavior)

// Additional nodes and relationships for the abstract
CREATE (Keyword {absID: "Keyword", name: "Keyword", synonym: "Term"})
CREATE (abs)-[:REL_CONTAINS]->(Keyword)

CREATE (Reference {absID: "Reference", name: "Reference", synonym: "Citation"})
CREATE (abs)-[:REL_CITED_IN]->(Reference)
```

In this graph database, we have the following entities:

* Abstract (abs)
* Host
* Pathogen
* Disease
* Symptom
* Sign
* Behavior
* Keyword
* Reference

The relationships between these entities are:

* `REL_ABSTRACTS`: An abstract can abstract multiple entities (Host, Pathogen, Disease, Symptom, Sign, Behavior)
* `REL_HOST_OF`: A host can have multiple diseases
* `REL_PATHOGEN_OF`: A pathogen can cause multiple diseases
* `REL_CAUSES`: A disease can cause multiple symptoms and signs
* `REL_EXPERIENCED_BY`: A symptom or sign can be experienced by multiple hosts
* `REL_PERFORMED_BY`: A behavior can be performed by multiple hosts
* `REL_INTERACTS_WITH`: Entities can interact with each other
* `REL_CONTAINS`: An abstract can contain multiple keywords
* `REL_CITED_IN`: An abstract can be cited in multiple references

Note that I've used the `absID` property to uniquely identify each node, as per your request. I've also used descriptive labels and properties to make the graph database easy to understand.
