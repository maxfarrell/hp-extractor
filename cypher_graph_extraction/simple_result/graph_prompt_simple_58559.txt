Note: The `absID` property is used to link each node and relationship to the original abstract. The `abs` property on the `Study` node is used to link the study to the abstract.

Here's a brief explanation of each node and relationship:

* `Abstract`: represents the abstract of the study
* `Study`: represents the study itself, with properties for name and abstract
* `Location`: represents the location where the study was conducted, with properties for name and country
* `Region`: represents a region within the location, with properties for name
* `Host`: represents the host species (white-tailed deer) with properties for name and scientific name
* `Pathogen`: represents the pathogen (Borrelia burgdorferi) with properties for name and synonym
* `SerumSample`: represents a serum sample collected from the host
* `SampleCollection`: represents the collection of serum samples
* `ELISA`: represents the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique used in the study
* `LOCATED_IN`: relationship between the study and the location where it was conducted
* `STUDIED_REGION`: relationship between the study and the region(s) where it was conducted
* `STUDIED_HOST`: relationship between the study and the host species
* `STUDIED_PATHOGEN`: relationship between the study and the pathogen
* `COLLECTED_SAMPLE`: relationship between the study and the serum sample
* `BELONGS_TO`: relationship between the serum sample and the sample collection
* `USED_TECHNIQUE`: relationship between the study and the ELISA technique used
