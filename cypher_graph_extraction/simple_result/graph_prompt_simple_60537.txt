Here is the graph database in Neo4j cypher format:

Note: I used the following labels and properties:

* `Abstract`: represents the abstract of the study
* `Study`: represents the study itself
* `Location`: represents the location where the study was conducted
* `Host`: represents the host organism (in this case, macaque monkeys)
* `Pathogen`: represents the pathogen being studied (in this case, Entamoeba dispar)
* `Method`: represents the method used in the study (in this case, polymerase chain reaction)
* `Test`: represents the specific test performed (in this case, PCR)
* `Result`: represents the result of the study

The relationships between these nodes are:

* `LOCATED_IN`: represents the location where the study was conducted
* `STUDIED_HOST`: represents the host organism being studied
* `STUDIED_PATHOGEN`: represents the pathogen being studied
* `USED_METHOD`: represents the method used in the study
* `PERFORMED_TEST`: represents the specific test performed
* `OBTAINED_RESULT`: represents the result of the study
